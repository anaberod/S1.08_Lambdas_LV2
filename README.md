
# 🧠 Java Lambdas Practice – Level 2

## 📄 Description - Exercise Overview

This project contains four Java exercises focused on advanced usage of **lambdas** and **streams** in Java 8+. The tasks reinforce functional programming concepts through filtering, mapping, sorting, and using functional interfaces.

### Exercise Summaries:

1. **Filter names** starting with 'A' and exactly 3 letters long.
2. **Transform a list of integers** into a comma-separated string with 'e' or 'o' prefixes depending on parity.
3. **Use a functional interface** to model mathematical operations (sum, subtraction, multiplication, division) with lambdas.
4. **Manipulate and filter a mixed list** of strings (some being numbers):
    - Sort alphabetically by first character.
    - Place strings with 'e' first.
    - Replace all 'a' with '4'.
    - Display only elements that are numeric.
